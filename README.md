# UART Communication System (Verilog)

This repository contains a complete Verilog implementation of a **Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)** with support for high-speed data transmission, FIFO buffering, and clock domain crossing.

## üìù Project Description

The UART module is designed to enable asynchronous serial communication between digital systems. It includes a **Baud Rate Generator**, **UART Transmitter (TX)**, **UART Receiver (RX)**, and **Asynchronous FIFO Buffers** to manage data flow between different clock domains.

This design is aimed at FPGA-based SoC integration and demonstrates how a UART peripheral can be built, verified, and prepared for system-level deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Baud Rate**: 921600 bps (Configurable)
- **Oversampling**: 16x for precise sampling
- **Parameterizable FIFO**: 8-bit data width, 16-depth, separate read/write clocks
- **Clean modular structure**: Easily extensible for SoC integration
- **Testbench included**: Basic and extended test cases
- **Synthesizable & FPGA-ready**
- **Vivado IP Integration**: FIFO generated using Vivado IP Catalog

## üß™ Verification

- Waveform simulations validate correct transmission and reception.
- Test cases include:
  - Single byte transfer
  - Multiple sequential writes (e.g., `0xAA`, `0x55`)
  - FIFO full/empty conditions
- Future work includes building a **UVM verification environment**.

## üîß Future Improvements

- Add error detection (parity, framing, overrun)
- Integrate with APB4 as a memory-mapped peripheral
- UVM-based verification
- Interrupt-based data handling
- Hardware prototyping and debugging with Vivado ILA
